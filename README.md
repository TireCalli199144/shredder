# Tire Calligraphy teaser visualizer 1
The purpose of the visualizer is to introduce the TC audience with the process, what once existed as an idea and what is coming, in short, the process. What once was envisioned as a fixed offering, meaning, the seasons dictated by the fashion industry, ie. (S)pring(S)ummer / (A)utumn(W)inter; became something more fluid. Not limited by constraints of time, location or (fashion) standards. As Bruce Lee once said, "Be water my friend".     
## Instalation and usage
The easiest way to run the vizualizer is to install `canvas-sketch-cli` globally which can be found [here](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch).
After that run the vizualizer by entering `canvas-sketch app.js -o` into your favourite terminal emulator.
